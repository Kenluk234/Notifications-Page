The challenge is to train my web developing skills by creating an notifications page as the test.

What I learned
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

Here is some preview of my code:
Html:
      <div class="notif" id="viewnotif">
        <div class="pfp">
          <img src="avatar-angela-gray.webp">
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
          <p>Angela Gray followed you</p>
          <span class="time">5m ago</span>
          <span class="notifbadge"></span>
        </div>
      </div>
  
Css:
  .notif {
  border-radius: 25px;
  border: 2px solid black;
  padding: 20px;
  width: auto;
  height: auto;
}

JS:
$('.notifbadge').click(function() {
    $('.notifbadge').hide();
});

Continued development
I plan to hone my web developing skills in the near future by doing some web development quizzes and practicing by making my own websites
